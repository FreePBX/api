# Contributing to GraphQL PHP

## Workflow

If your contribution requires significant or breaking changes, or if you plan to propose a major new feature,
we recommend you to create an issue on the [Github](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php/issues) with 
a brief proposal and discuss it with us first.

For smaller contributions just use this workflow:

* Fork the project.
* Add your features and or bug fixes.
* Add tests. Tests are important for us.
* Send a pull request
